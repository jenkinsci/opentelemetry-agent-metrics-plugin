<div>A boolean flag (default: true). When true, the node_exporter and otel-contrib processes are launched.
	When false, these processes are not launched and the metrics are expected to be gathered outside the
	control of this plugin (eg. by scraping kubernetes metrics) and all other fields with the exception of
	<code>Override dashboard URL</code> will be ignored.
	Check the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry-agent-metrics/">opentelemetry-agent-metrics</a> plugin documentation for guidance
	how to set up an OpenTelemetry pipeline linking metrics to a specific build and agent.</div>
