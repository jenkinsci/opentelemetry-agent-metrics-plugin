<div>A timeout of given seconds to wait before returning control to the job,
	this allows Prometheus node exporter to start before there is a need for it.
	By default set to 0, not to delay the build, since it usually takes just a
	few seconds for Prometheus node exporter to start and usually a job does not
	immediately exhaust all CPU/memory resources.</div>
